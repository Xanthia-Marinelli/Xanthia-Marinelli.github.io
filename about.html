                <h1 class="hero-title"><span>About</span> Me</h1>
                <p>I’m a third-year Bachelor of Education (Secondary) / Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation & Technologies) student at Australian Catholic University. My main teaching areas are Textiles, Timber, and Design & Technology, with additional experience in Metalwork, Food and Nutrition, Engineering, and Computing. My teaching practice is guided by a strong focus on sustainability, creativity, and design thinking.</p>

                <p>I’m passionate about hands-on learning where students build skills through purposeful projects connected to real-world contexts.</p>
                
                <p> My classroom practice emphasises safety, skill development, and empowering students to explore, problem-solve, and take ownership of their ideas. During my teacher training, I’ve completed placements at Marist Sisters College Woolwich, St Vincent's College Ashfield, and Casimir College Marrickville. These experiences have shaped my approach to learning by doing and reinforced my commitment to authentic, student-centred teaching. </p>

                <p> Outside of teaching, I work as a <a href="https://www.stuntbookaustralia.com.au/member-profile-details.php?sba_member=763"target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunt performer</a> in the Australian film industry. This unique career keeps me active, creative, and constantly learning. It’s a big part of what inspires my teaching practice. Whether I’m in the classroom or on set, I bring energy, focus, and a passion for purposeful design to everything I do.</p>
