            <h3>Project Title:</h3>
            <h4>Investigating the Thermal Conductivity of Textiles</h4>
            <h3>Brief Description:</h3>
            <p> A scientific laboratory report investigating the thermal conductivity of textiles. It explores how thickness (neoprene) and humidity (wool) affect the rate at which heat is transferred. The experiment measures how quickly water cools when insulated with different textile samples. Results showed that thicker neoprene slowed heat loss, while wool with higher humidity (wet wool) conducted heat faster than dry wool. </p>
