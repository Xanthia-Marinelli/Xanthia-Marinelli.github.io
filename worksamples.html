                        <p>"Innovate to Advocate" is a unit where students research a social or environmental issue and design, construct, and present a textile item (such as a garment or accessory) that communicates their chosen message. Through project-based learning, they build skills in design, communication, and manufacturing while using textiles as a medium for advocacy, culminating in a Mini Major Project and process journal.</p>
