                            <p class="center">"Innovate to Advocate" is a unit where students research a social or environmental issue and design, construct, and present a textile item (such as a garment or accessory) that communicates their chosen message. Through project-based learning, they build skills in design, communication, and manufacturing while using textiles as a medium for advocacy, culminating in a Mini Major Project and process journal.</p>

                            <p class="center">In this unit students undertake the design, development and prototyping process to create their own wearable technology gadget. Studentsinvestigate electronic circuits and batteries. Students look at the impact of existing wearable technologies on society and explore the current marketplace and opportunities for a new wearable technology for a targeted audience. Students work in teams to collaboratively design an idea for a wearable gadget and build a prototype to help pitch their idea.</p>
