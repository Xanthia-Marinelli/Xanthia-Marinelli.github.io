                            <p>The project is a 1:5 scale foam core model of a cupboard, created to test proportions, structure, and design features before constructing the real version. The model highlights an innovative feature: the cupboard has no back legs, allowing it to sit flush against a wall. This project demonstrates how designers use scaled prototypes to visualise and refine ideas before committing to full-scale builds, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in production.</p>

It combines plywood, acrylic, and LED strips to create a sculptural light piece that works as both a piece of art and a functional light, appealing to LOTR fans who value unique memorabilia that fits into modern home décor. Prototyping, experimentation, and adjustments (like testing hanging methods and acrylic scaling) were central to the design process.</p>

                            <p>A complex break down of the Tomtoc Defender-A40 Laptop Bag, designed for 14-inch laptops like the MacBook Pro to study how each feature contributes to its function, appearance, and user experience. The case study explored the bag’s purpose (protection and portability), design features (shock-absorbing padding, slim profile, compartments, adjustable strap), and materials (recycled polyester, nylon, PU leather, foam, plastic hardware). It also evaluated sustainability claims, looked at ergonomics and user comfort, and compared it to a premium leather briefcase.</p>
